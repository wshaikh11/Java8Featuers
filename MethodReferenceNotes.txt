MethodReference : MR is a special type of lambda expression that execute only one method
Syntax : Object::methodName : Object is reference to call the method and methodName is the method call
- We directely can't write Object::methodName, instead we should write it in lambda expression where we are calling a method
- There are 2 types of method reference
1] static MR
2] instance MR
3] constructor MR

- For instance MR we need to create the object of the class and then call the objectName::methodName, but if there are no argument to the fuction, then it behaves as static, mo need to create the object
